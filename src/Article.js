      <h1>NFT Shill Art - EP #1</h1>
      
      <h3>Preface by Doge Destiny, Founder of NFT Item Land Shill art is a new term for describing an upcoming phenomenon in the modern art space. Since the inception of NFTs in our shared reality, art has evolved in ways impossible to conceive even just a couple of years prior. The abstract pathways unearthed by this new token technology has driven the market to produce a more drastic, stylistic, and emotionally charged version of what we know as art. Without further delay, here's Gifted, art connoisseur, and his take on what Shill Art is.</h3>
